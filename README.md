# [krypton](https://github.com/astei/krypton)
Krypton is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work done in the Velocity and Tuinity projects.

# [Lazydfu](https://github.com/astei/lazydfu)
LazyDFU is an optimization mod that makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper "lazy" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so. It does not modify DFU and should be safe, but do exercise more than the usual caution.

# [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric)
Lithium is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which works to optimize many areas of the game in order to provide better overall performance. It works on both the client and server, and doesn't require the mod to be installed on both sides.
